		<h1>Algorithm</h1>
		<p>An algorithm (pronounced AL-go-rith-um) is a procedure or formula for solving a problem, based on conducting a sequence of specified actions. A computer program can be viewed as an elaborate algorithm. In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm usually means a small procedure that solves a recurrent problem.</p>

		<h1>Searching Algorithm</h1>
		<p>A search algorithm is the step-by-step procedure used to locate specific data among a collection of data. It is considered a fundamental procedure in computing. In computer science, when searching for data, the difference between a fast application and a slower one often lies in the use of the proper search algorithm.</p>

		<h1>Sorting Algorithm</h1>
		<p>A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure. For example: The below list of characters is sorted in increasing order of their ASCII values.</p>
		<ul type="circle">
			<li>Quick sort</li>
			<li>Bubble sort</li>
			<li>Selection sort</li>
			<li>Insertion sort</li>
			<li>Counting sort</li>
		</ul>
